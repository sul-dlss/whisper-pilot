{"text": " The last family to be adopted by the Germans in 1952 We were the last family to be adopted by the Germans in 1952. Andra was the last family to be adopted by the Germans in 1952. We were the last family to be sent to America. I remember that because we have photos and articles of how my parents were so lucky to have been sent to America. I think we were the last family. We had to come earlier. We had already been informed in the letters that we would be sent to America. My grandmother came a year earlier. My brother was born in November just before that. I think it was true. When we were the last family, there was the Hungarian Revolution. They started bringing us from Hungary. We were invited to New York. I remember it so well. I was seven or eight. We stood there with American flags and greeted them. It was very exciting for me because I was so young. For the first time I was in a hotel somewhere. We didn't get a lot of answers, we did interviews and so on. I think that when we were the last ones, we were called Flying Tiger Airlines. I know that we flew over Irima, and we had to stop at Irima. There was something wrong with the plane, I don't know if it was a propeller or something. But then again, it got better and I think we were there for a very long time. or something like that, and then he went to New York. So we don't usually have that ship number either. Then he took a bus to Seabrook. Seabrook is a small village in Luna, New Jersey, and it's maybe three hours, four hours by bus from New York. And Seabrook, because there was a job there that was called Seabrook Farms, Charles F. Seabrook, Ebrock had been building a large house and a cooling factory there for over 30-40 years. It was one of the first deep cooling factories in America. It was made with a deep cooling of glass and wood. And it needed a lot of work. And it needed a lot of work especially in the summer months, when the weather was just right, when everything was growing. Before the Estonians appeared there, the Japanese had come there. And why did the Japanese... When America was at war with Japan, the Japanese were also sent to the concentration camps. Because the Japanese who lived in America, when there were deaths in America, they began to die there, or they began to die there, but most of them, maybe you know, to connect with Japan and do some kind of great work or I don't know what they were doing. They came from Japan, they had their own homes, their own houses, and it was kind of a transportation too, not only, you know, like a Russian transportation. Every year they were put in camp, they were told to take what they could carry with them, and they were put in camp for a few years. And then when the war ended, They couldn't go back because they were liquidated or sold. Maybe some of them did, but most of them had to start a new life. They also came to Cyprus, because Cyprus gave them work and a life. In the middle of the 50s there were maybe 600 people, 600 Estonians. In my opinion, I have read somewhere that in the 50s, 600 Estonians. In my opinion, I have read somewhere that at least 1,000 Estonians ever moved through there. Some people moved there only for a couple of months. Maybe they got contact with their relatives or better jobs somewhere. But we lived there. I lived there for 12 years. I think that's why my father had a good place to live. The people there were informed, they were given a room to live in. There was furniture, clothes, laundry, all sorts of things. They were given a room where they could buy clothes that they needed. There was clothing there. And my friends were, when I was growing up, Japanese and Estonians. We were always the first ones in the class. We had a tough life in Estonia. You were in the Estonian Holy Day School, which was held on Saturday. You had a church component, but also the Estonian language, a little bit of practice, singing in Estonian, dance, Estonian culture. They wrote in Estonian, packed in Estonian. It was a big part of my life, to be able to pack in Estonian. I remember how they gathered the months, what to get, what was needed in Estonia, if it was possible to get some overseas countries. Then, of course, the countries from which I grew up myself, what were the good conditions, especially since it was me and I had three brothers at the end. Two of my brothers were born in Zibruk. They opened a coffee shop for sure. I don't know what else they were doing there. They planned for a long time what they were doing there. And then finally the packing was done and there was a line around it. It was like a line on the address. I don't know if they had to go to Philadelphia. I think I had to go somewhere far away to find it. I had to find it somewhere in Europe or in Estonia. When I was five months old, the first letters of 54-55, I think, started to return. I remember that my old father, Herman Merikani Öde, who was still alive in Tartu, had changed his name a bit. He had changed his name to Merikandi. because I didn't want to deny that he was my great-grandfather's relative, my great-grandfather, who was a police officer. And the letters started to go around in such a way that in the beginning this letter wasn't even for my great-grandfather. You know, somehow I wanted to name who you were writing to, because there was also the feeling that you didn't want to hurt people who live in Estonia, someone who had been killed in the war in Germany or in the police or something like that. That's how I got in touch with them. These letters were read and understood by my mother and grandmother all the time. What was going on there and what was going on there. That was the trial. They reminded me of Estonia all the time. And what always made me laugh was that My mother always had a different way of remembering things. It was like that today. No, it wasn't like that, it was like that today. What do you know? You were so young then, you didn't remember anything. No, I know very well, you know things like that. The thing I grew up with, and my mother was like, oh, she was such a great communist, Russian, red-skinned, and we were not red-skinned either. That was for sure. And all that was in the world, what was the reason for the red communists, the Russian children, that was also certain. But my mother, well, she was 16 when she left. And plus, she has this thing, I've heard so much about it, that her parents were killed. Her parents were killed pretty quickly. One father, Suri, and his father-in-law, Sibiris Otsa. There were three children in the house. One of them was a mother. The mother was wearing a scarf. At least my mother told me that she threw the scarf out of the window. When you grow up, your parents... I remember... Friends you grow up with, who are not Estonians, but Americans, they have old mothers, old fathers, They have fathers, grandfathers, grandfathers, great-grandchildren. You read children's stories, let's go to the great-grandchildren and see what old things are there. I didn't have these things. We didn't have old things anywhere. We only had things that we had when we came. We didn't have old memories of this country. All our things were in Estonia, our memories, our great-grandchildren, our great-grandchildren, our great-grandchildren. There was a fire in Estonia, a house fire. There was one person who had never been there, but it was a house fire. You get off the ship and you see that there are... I don't know if you've ever been on a wheel or a boat. You're on this side and you can see through it. I quickly stepped on it and everyone was standing next to it. I feel like I've seen them all in real life, but I grew up with these books, like my old mother, we used to read them all the time. I stood up and started to read. They were Levi, Elmo, Kai, Mati. And it was like, don't recognize people who you grew up with but haven't seen in real life, but they are your own bodies.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 10.0, "text": " The
