{"text": " We were the last family that came from Germany in 1952. We were the last family that they took to America. I remember it because we have pictures and articles about how my grandparents were so lucky that they were able to go to America. I think we were the last family. That's why. We were born in November. We were born in November. We were born in November. My mother had a baby and my brother was born in November. I think it was because of that. Since we were the last family, when the Hungarian revolution came and they started bringing the refugees from Hungary, we were invited to New York. I remember it so well. I was 7 or 8 years old. We were staying in the US. We were staying in the US. We were staying with the refugees and we were welcoming them. It was especially exciting for me because I was so young. For the first time I was in a hotel somewhere. We got to meet very well and did interviews. I think that since we were the last family, we became Flying Tiger Airlines. I know that we flew over Ireland and we had to fly around Ireland because of a problem with the propeller. I don't know if it was a propeller or something. But then again they repaired it and I don't think we were there very long, maybe more than an hour or something, and then back to New York. So we don't have that ship history either. Then they immediately brought the buses to Seabrook. Seabrook is a small village in Lona, New Jersey, and it's probably about three or four hours by bus from New York. And Seabrook was there because there was a factory called Seabrook Farms. Charles F. Seabrook had been building a large farm for over 30-40 years and a cooling plant there. And it was one of the first deep cooling plants in the U.S. It was immediately made with a deep cooling plant. And it took a lot of work. And it took a lot of work. The construction work ended in the summer, when it was just the time of harvest, when everything was growing. Before the Estonians came there, the Japanese came there. And the Japanese, because when America was at war with Japan, the Japanese also put them in storage tanks. Because the Japanese who lived in America, because there were wars in America, they began to dig here or began to dig more, maybe, you know, to connect with Japan and do some kind of big work. Or I don't know what they did. They were Japanese who had lived for years. They had their own homes, their own houses. And it had to be like moving, too. Not only, you know, it was like moving to Russia. Anyway, they put them in warehouses. They were told, take what you can carry with you. They had been in warehouses for a few years. And when the war ended, then they were told, you know, go now, live, search. Of course, their homes and places where they had already been. They couldn't go back there anymore. Whether they had been liquidated or sold. Maybe some of them got alone. But basically it was like they had to start a new life. So they came to Seabrook, too. Because Seabrook gave them jobs and a life. In the mid-50s, there was... Maybe about 600 people there. 600 Estonians. From my point of view, I've read somewhere that at least 1000 Estonians ever moved through there. Some people came there only for a couple of months and moved on. Maybe they got some contact with other relatives or some better jobs somewhere. But we didn't live there. I lived there for 12 years. I think that's why my father had a good point of view there. When people came there, they were immediately given a place to live. There was furniture inside. There was a toilet. There was a toilet. All sorts of things were there. They were given... There was a place where they could buy food that they needed. There was a nursing home there. And my friends were there when I was growing up. Japanese and Estonians. And we were like... Curious. We were always in the first classes there. We had a very close relationship with Estonia. There was an Estonian Sunday school that worked on Saturdays. But there was a church component, but also a little bit of Estonian practice. Singing in Estonian. National dance. A little bit of Estonian culture. And Estonian books, packages to Estonia. It was a big part of my life. To get packages to Estonia. I remember how we gathered for several months. To see what we could get. What we needed in Estonia. Did anyone want to get some extra money. Then, of course, the money we had grown up with. It was such a good experience. Especially since it was me. I had three grandchildren. Two of them were born in Sibruk. We always had a coffee pack. I don't know where else we went. We had been planning for a long time. How to put it in there. And then, finally, making the package. And then some kind of fence around it. So that it would be solid. And then an address. I don't know if we had to go to Philadelphia. I think we had to go somewhere far away. Where we could get it. Where we could get it in Europe. Or in Estonia. When I was five or six years old. In 1954 or 1955. I think my first books. I started going back and forth. I remember that my great-great-grandfather. My great-great-grandfather Herman Merikandi Öde. Who still lived in Tartu. His name had changed a little. He had gone to Merikandi. He was a Merikandi. Because. He was my great-great-grandfather's relative. Great-great-grandfather who was a police officer. So. And the books always went. So that in the beginning. That book wasn't for my great-great-grandfather. You know. At some point. You couldn't name who you were really going to write to. Because there was always this feeling. That you didn't want to do bad to the people who live in Estonia. That someone who has left. And. Who was maybe. In the German army. Or in the police. Or whatever. That it's like. Now in contact with them. These books. They were read. They were understood. My grandmother and grandmother. All the time. And. What was going on there. And thinking. Here. And. That was the test. And. And. And they reminded me of Estonia. All the time. And. What I always remembered was. That. My. Grandmother. Always was. Different. From one thing to another. It was like that today. No. It wasn't like that today. It was like that today. What do you know. You were so young. You couldn't remember anything. No. I know very well. You know. Such things. This thing. With which I grew up. And. My mother was. Oh. She was so big. Communists. Russians. Red things. And. We didn't want to carry red. That was for sure. And. Everything in the world. What was. Red. Communists. That was for sure. But. My mother was. Oh. She was sixteen. When she came. And. Plus. She. She has. This. This thing. I've heard so much. That. She was. Carried away. Um. She was. Probably killed. Right away. Pretty quickly. Down. One. Dad. Fell. And. A tree. Where she. Fell. And. Why. Fell. On the tree. And. At least. My mother's. Story. Was. That. She. Was thrown. Out. Of the tree. She. Fell. As. A child. When. You. Grow. Up. On the tree. I remember. That. Yeah. Friends. With. You. And. I was. From. The. French. So. And. And. We. I swear. That. I'm. I'm. We. I'm. I'm. I'm. You. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. You finally get down from the ship, and you see that there are wheels, wheels, and you are on this side, and you see through it, it was like a spiral wheel, and I immediately walked there, and everyone was standing there in a row, and I felt them all. I had not seen them in my life, but I had grown up with books, like my grandmother and grandmother, for a long time we understood them. I stood there, I said, think, and there were Livi, Elmo, Kai, Matti, and it was really a pleasure to meet people with whom you have grown up a little, but you have not seen them in your life, but they are your own right now.
