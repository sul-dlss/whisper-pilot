{"text": " We are the last family that came from Germany in 1952. who was the last family that they took to America. I remember it because we have pictures and articles of how my parents were so lucky to have them in America. And I think we were the last family because we had to come earlier. There was a letter that said that we had to come to America. My grandmother came a year earlier. But then my mother took the child and my brother was born in November just before that. And I think the truth was that it was because of that. And since we were the last family, then later, when there was the Hungarian Revolution, and Hungary began to bring these refugees, then we were invited to New York. I remember it so well. I was seven or eight years old. We were standing there with the American flags and we were greeting them. It was especially exciting for me because I was so young. For the first time I was in a hotel somewhere. We received a very nice response, we did interviews. I think since we were the last ones, we became Flying Tiger Airlines. I know that we flew over to Irma and we had to leave Irma I don't know if it was a propeller or something else that was a problem. But then they fixed it again and I don't think we stayed there very long. Maybe more than a night or something. And then back to New York. So we don't have that ship number either. Then they immediately brought the buses to Seabrook. Seabrook is a small town in Lona, New Jersey, and it's about 3-4 hours by bus from New York. Seabrook was founded by a company called Seabrook Farms. Charles F. Seabrook had over 30-40 years of experience in building a big house and a cold factory there. It was one of the first deep cooling plants in America that was made with a deep cooling plant. And it needed work. And it needed work especially in the summer months, when it was the harvest season, when everything was growing. Before the Estonians arrived, the Japanese had arrived. When America was at war with Japan, the Japanese also put them in death camps. The Japanese who lived in the US, when there was a war in the US, they started to work in Japan and do some kind of big jobs, or I don't know what they did. They were Japanese who had lived there for years. They had their own homes and houses. And it was more or less like boarding, you know, like boarding in Russia. Anyway, they were put in camps. They were told, take what you can carry with you. They were in camps for a couple of years. And when the war ended, they were told, you know, go now. They couldn't go back to their homes and places they had already been to. They couldn't go back there anymore, because they had been liquidated or sold. Maybe some of them got it, but the main thing was that they had to start a new life. So they came to Siipruk, because Siipruk offered them work and a life. In the middle of the 1950s, there were about 600 people there, 600 Estonians. I have read somewhere that at least a thousand Estonians ever moved through here. Some people came here only for a couple of months and moved on. Maybe they got some contact with other relatives or some better employment somewhere. But we didn't live here. I lived here for 12 years. I think that's why my father had a good point to make. When people came here, they were immediately given a place to live. There was furniture, there was a toilet, there was a toilet, all sorts of things. They were given a place where they could buy food that they needed. There was a nursing home there. And my friends were, when I was growing up, Japanese and Estonians. We were always in the first classes of the school. We had a very close relationship with Estonia. It was an Estonian high school that was open on holidays, but it had a church component, but also a bit of Estonian practice, singing in Estonian, folk dance, Estonian culture. And books from Estonia, packages from Estonia, it was a big part of my life to get a package to Estonia. I remember how they gathered a few months, what to get, what Estonia needed, if anyone wanted to, if it was possible to get some overseas gifts. Then of course gifts from which we had grown up ourselves, which were still in such a good condition, especially since it was me and finally I had three brothers. The two sisters were born in Sibruk. They always had a coffee box. I don't know where they went to. For a long time they planned how to put it in there. Finally, the making of the box and some kind of fence around it, so that it would look like a castle, and then an address. I don't know if I had to go to Philadelphia, but I think I had to go to somewhere far away to get it. Where I could get it in Europe or in Estonia. When I was five or six years old, I think my first books started to go back and forth. I remember that my great-great-grandfather Herman Merikani Öde, who still lived in Tartu, had changed his name a bit. He was an American, because he was my grandfather's relative, who was a police officer. And the books always ended up like this. In the beginning, the book wasn't meant for my grandfather. You know, at some point, you couldn't name the person you were going to write to. They didn't want to hurt the people who lived in Estonia. Someone who had fled, who was in the German army or in the police. That's how I'm in contact with them now. They read the books, they understood them. My mother and grandmother got together. What was happening there and what was happening here. It was a test, and they reminded me of Estonia all the time. And what I always had in mind was that my grandmother always had a different memory of things. She was like this today. No, she wasn't like this today. She was like this today. What do you know? You were so young, you couldn't remember anything. No, I know very well, you know, such things. The story I grew up with, my mother was such a big fan of communists, Russians, red things, and we were not allowed to wear red. That was for sure. And everything in the world that was the cause of red communists, Russians, that was also for sure. But my mother was there. She was 16 when she was released. Plus, she had this thing, I've heard so much about it, that her grandson was taken away. The grandson was probably killed right away, pretty quickly. One father died, and the tree where he was buried was broken. The other, those who were taken away from him, there were three children, one was a mother. My mother used to say that she always threw the basket out of the window when she was a child. When you grow up as an orphan, I remember my friends who are not Estonians, but Americans, They have grandparents, grandparents, aunts, aunts, relatives, children's stories. You read children's stories, let's go to the children's stories and see what old things are there. I didn't have any of those things. We didn't have anything old. We only had the things we had when we came. We didn't have any old memories in this country. All our things were in Estonia, our memories, our children's stories, our old things, our relatives. The fire in Estonia was like a fire in a house. It had never been in a person's life, but it was a fire in a house. You come down from the ship and then you see... I don't know if it was a wheel, but it was a wheel. You're here and you see through it. It was like a spiral wheel. I immediately stepped in and everyone was standing in line. I felt them all. I haven't seen them in my life, but I grew up with books, like my grandmother and grandmother, we used to read them all the time. I stood there and said, listen, Livi, Elmo, Kai, Matti, you are wonderful people who have grown up a little, but have not seen life, but they are your own people.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 17.0, "text": " We are the last family that came from Germany in 1952.", "tokens": [50365, 492, 366, 264, 1036, 1605, 300, 1361, 490, 7244, 294, 10858, 17, 13, 51215], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.9376737370210535, "compression_ratio": 0.9, "no_speech_prob": 0.11359265446662903}, {"id": 1, "seek": 1700, "start": 17.0, "end": 33.0, "text": " who was the last family that they took to America.", "tokens": [50365, 567, 390, 264, 1036, 1605, 300, 436, 1890, 281, 3374, 13, 51165], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.6990852355957031, "compression_ratio": 1.3361344537815125, "no_speech_prob": 0.02695048227906227}, {"id": 2, "seek": 1700, "start": 33.0, "end": 44.0, "text": " I remember it because we have pictures and articles of how my parents were so lucky to have them in America.", "tokens": [51165, 286, 1604, 309, 570, 321, 362, 5242, 293, 11290, 295, 577, 452, 3152, 645, 370, 6356, 281, 362, 552, 294, 3374, 13, 51715], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.6990852355957031, "compression_ratio": 1.3361344537815125, "no_speech_prob": 0.02695048227906227}, {"id": 3, "seek": 4400, "start": 44.0, "end": 48.0, "text": " And I think we were the last family because we had to come earlier.", "tokens": [50365, 400, 286, 519, 321, 645, 264, 1036, 1605, 570, 321, 632, 281, 808, 3071, 13, 50565], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4274364699665298, "compression_ratio": 1.8084291187739463, "no_speech_prob": 0.34692299365997314}, {"id": 4, "seek": 4400, "start": 48.0, "end": 53.0, "text": " There was a letter that said that we had to come to America.", "tokens": [50565, 821, 390, 257, 5063, 300, 848, 300, 321, 632, 281, 808, 281, 3374, 13, 50815], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4274364699665298, "compression_ratio": 1.8084291187739463, "no_speech_prob": 0.34692299365997314}, {"id": 5, "seek": 4400, "start": 53.0, "end": 55.0, "text": " My grandmother came a year earlier.", "tokens": [50815, 1222, 14317, 1361, 257, 1064, 3071, 13, 50915], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4274364699665298, "compression_ratio": 1.8084291187739463, "no_speech_prob": 0.34692299365997314}, {"id": 6, "seek": 4400, "start": 55.0, "end": 59.0, "text": " But then my mother took the child and my brother was born in November just before that.", "tokens": [50915, 583, 550, 452, 2895, 1890, 264, 1440, 293, 452, 3708, 390, 4232, 294, 7674, 445, 949, 300, 13, 51115], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4274364699665298, "compression_ratio": 1.8084291187739463, "no_speech_prob": 0.34692299365997314}, {"id": 7, "seek": 4400, "start": 59.0, "end": 62.0, "text": " And I think the truth was that it was because of that.", "tokens": [51115, 400, 286, 519, 264, 3494, 390, 300, 309, 390, 570, 295, 300, 13, 51265], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4274364699665298, "compression_ratio": 1.8084291187739463, "no_speech_prob": 0.34692299365997314}, {"id": 8, "seek": 4400, "start": 62.0, "end": 66.0, "text": " And since we were the last family, then later, when there was the Hungarian Revolution,", "tokens": [51265, 400, 1670, 321, 645, 264, 1036, 1605, 11, 550, 1780, 11, 562, 456, 390, 264, 38034, 16617, 11, 51465], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4274364699665298, "compression_ratio": 1.8084291187739463, "no_speech_prob": 0.34692299365997314}, {"id": 9, "seek": 4400, "start": 66.0, "end": 71.0, "text": " and Hungary began to bring these refugees, then we were invited to New York.", "tokens": [51465, 293, 32380, 4283, 281, 1565, 613, 18301, 11, 550, 321, 645, 9185, 281, 1873, 3609, 13, 51715], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.4274364699665298, "compression_ratio": 1.8084291187739463, "no_speech_prob": 0.34692299365997314}, {"id": 10, "seek": 7100, "start": 71.0, "end": 75.0, "text": " I remember it so well.
